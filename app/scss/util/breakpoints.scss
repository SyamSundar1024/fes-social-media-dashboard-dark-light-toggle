// This is going to be a mixin that I am using in my projects for just a faster way to load your media queries.

//We are going to use a mixin so that we can reuse the code every time we need to write a media query. 
//Since we are using this mixin, if we ever want to change (min-width or others) from 50 ems to 64 ems in the media query, then we don't have to go and do a huge find and replace through all our styles. we can just change it in one place here in this breakpoints file.
